                    of the county as we are battling with one of the worst economic crisis that we have experienced. This is
                    the time as volunteers, to do our part to the society. So this year the district will strongly encourage clubs
                    to perform and introduce sustainable projects that actually has an impact to the society. As a district we

                    The year 2022/2023 will be a year focusing on the growth and development of the movement along with
                    encouraging clubs and all Leos to conduct projects that will benefit the society thereby maximizing the
                    impact that we have on the society while encouraging all leos to be better human beings. So the vision for
                    the year is to maximize the impact of service to the society and change existing associated paradigms
                    thereby introducing novel concepts and projects aligning with the Sustainable Development Goals
                    introduced by the United Nations. This vision was introduced taking into consideration the current status
                    of the county as we are battling with one of the worst economic crisis that we have experienced. This is
                    the time as volunteers, to do our part to the society. So this year the district will strongly encourage clubs
                    to perform and introduce sustainable projects that actually has an impact to the society. As a district we
                    also believe that innovation is the mother of sustainable growth and development of any club and we will
                    strive to promote it as far as possible this year. So taking into consideration the above, the theme for this
                    year will be “Changing Paradigms”
